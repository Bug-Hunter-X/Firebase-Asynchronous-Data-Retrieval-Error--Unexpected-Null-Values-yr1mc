# Firebase Asynchronous Data Retrieval Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug when working with Firebase Realtime Database asynchronous operations. The bug arises from attempting to access data from a query before the asynchronous operation completes, leading to unexpected `null` or `undefined` values.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file shows how accessing data immediately after initiating a Firebase query can cause errors.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, uses async/await to correctly handle the asynchronous nature of the Firebase database operations.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a Firebase project and install the Firebase JavaScript SDK.
3. Configure your Firebase credentials.
4. Run `bug.js`. Observe the unexpected `null` value initially printed.
5. Run `bugSolution.js`. Observe the correct data being handled.
