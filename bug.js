The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to data retrieval and asynchronous operations.  This occurs when attempting to access data from a Firebase Realtime Database query before the asynchronous operation has completed. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as accessing `null` or undefined values, rather than the expected data.

```javascript
const database = firebase.database();
const ref = database.ref('users');

ref.once('value', (snapshot) => {
  const users = snapshot.val();
  console.log('Users:', users); // This might print 'Users: null' initially!
});

// Attempting to access 'users' immediately will result in an error
console.log('Users (outside promise):', users); // users is not defined here
```
